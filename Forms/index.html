		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p class="SideLeft">	Hello, I am Shahila from Luvable Cakes. I absolutely love to cook and try out new recipes.

My deep interest and passion in baking have lead me back to school again. Only this time, it's baking classes instead of Computer Science courses. My passion grew stronger after I was awarded with a Professional Diploma in Sugarpaste (2009) from Pastry Pro. <br></p>

<p> Since then, I have been actively receiving orders and bookings for my lovely delicious cupcakes and freshly baked cakes from families, cousins, friends, colleagues and the words spread around so quickly. I am now providing my creative baking services, online; in a full time basis. Please feel free to view my photo gallery to see all the beautiful tantalizing cupcakes and cakes which I have made for my clients weddings and special occasions.

Modern pastry chefs and cake designers use various ingredients and tools to create a cake that usually reflects the personalities of the couple. Marzipan, fondant, gum paste, buttercream, and chocolate are among the popular ingredients used. Cakes range in price along with size and components. <br></p> 
		<p> Cakes are usually priced on a per-person, or per-slice, basis.Prices can range from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars per-person or slice, depending on the pastry chef who is hired to make the cake. Wedding cakes and cake decorating in general have become a certain pop culture symbol in western society.

Wedding cakes in England and early America were traditionally fruit cakes, often topped with marzipan and icing with tiers, Cutting the cake was an important part of the reception. Today, many flavors and configurations are available in addition to the traditional all-white tiered cake.</p>
