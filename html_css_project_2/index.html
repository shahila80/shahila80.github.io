			<h5>Paris,France</h5> 
			<p>Paris is the capital and the most populous city of France. It has an area of 105 km² (41 mi²) and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within the city limits. Paris is both a commune and department, and forms the centre and headquarters of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an area of 12,012 square kilometers (4,638 square miles) and a population in 2014 of 12,005,077, comprising 18.2 percent of the population of France.</p>

			<p>Paris was founded in the 3rd century BC by a Celtic people called the Parisii, who gave the city its name. By the 12th century, Paris was the largest city in the western world, a prosperous trading centre, and the home of the University of Paris, one of the oldest universities in history. By the 17th century it was one of Europe's major centres of finance, commerce, fashion, science, and the arts, and it retains that position still today.</p>
